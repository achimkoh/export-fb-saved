# Export Facebook saved links

The jupyter notebook runs a headless browser, scroll all the way down to the FB saved page, then save the links and descriptions into a text file. 

I've noticed the number that shows on top of the saved page is slightly bigger than the actual number of extracted urls. So maybe this script misses some links.. but 745 out of 757 is good enough for me, I just want to have a quick look at what I've saved over the years (which I would never do otherwise) and maybe some of them are useful.
